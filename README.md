## Hi my name is Beatriz Andreucci 


I am a 20 year old information systems student, finishing the Apple Developer Program | Mackenzie program where i had the opportunity to experience and learn mainly about the programming area, developing applications in Swift and SwiftUI, in addition to working on some projects using UIKit and Sprite Kit. I participated in the process of creating the applications, maintaining constant contact with the designers and, on some occasions, creating the design of some screens, taking care of the user experience and carrying out user tests.
During this process, I also had the chance to learn and apply concepts from the product area, following the SCRUM methodology, carrying out market analysis, interviews with experts from different areas and even securing strategic partnerships.

👩🏻‍💻 Some of my projects:

🎸 Tabsy - Aprenda a ler tablaturas:

An app with a cheerful orange guitar pick that teaches how to read tablatures through gamified, intuitive and acessible activities. With the help of a color-coded system inspired by the Figurenotes method, widely used to support learners with cognitive disorder. Developed in Swift and Swift UI, using acessible tools such as dynamic type and voice over.

This app had 10.7K impressions on the App Store, with a 5.0/5.0 stars rating. And it was also the winner of the Education Category of the Campus Mobile competition.
