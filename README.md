## Hi my name is Beatriz Andreucci 


I am a 20 year old information systems student, finishing the Apple Developer Program | Mackenzie where i had the opportunity to experience and learn mainly about the programming area, developing applications in Swift and SwiftUI, in addition to working on some projects using UIKit and Sprite Kit. I participated in the process of creating the applications, maintaining constant contact with the designers and, on some occasions, creating the design of some screens, taking care of the user experience and carrying out user tests.
During this process, I also had the chance to learn and apply concepts from the product area, following the SCRUM methodology, carrying out market analysis, interviews with experts from different areas and even securing strategic partnerships.

👩🏻‍💻 Some of my projects:

🎸 Tabsy - Aprenda a ler tablaturas:

An app with a cheerful orange guitar pick that teaches how to read tablatures through gamified, intuitive and acessible activities. With the help of a color-coded system inspired by the Figurenotes method, widely used to support learners with cognitive disorder. Developed in Swift and Swift UI, using acessible tools such as dynamic type and voice over.

This app had 10.7K impressions on the App Store, with a 5.0/5.0 stars rating. And it was also the winner of the Education Category of the Campus Mobile competition.


🎮 Projeto Aurora:

Um Serious Game de matemática para crianças resolverem desafios de raciocínio lógico para desvendar o passado e pôr fim a um mistério que assombra a família de Ana em uma narrativa intrigante e educativa. Desenvolvido em Swift e Sprite Kit.

🎩 Dandie:

An app focused on the male public to help them create and maintain a self care routine, providing them tips in a practical and simple way according to your daily life. Giving tips on tasks, how to perform them and products that can be used.
